Test of the hypothesis that 3 factors are sufficient.
The chi square statistic is 2.29 on 3 degrees of freedom.
The p-value is 0.514 

 Sepal length, petal length, and petal width are strongly explained by factor 1.
    Sepal width is well explained by factor 2.

    I chose 3 factors because this is what gave me a p-value > 0.05, meaning 
    the model fits the data well or that there is not enough evidence to reject 
    the null hypothesis that the model fits the data well. 
    4 factors were too many for 7 variables and 2 factors had an insanely high 
    chi squared statistic as well as a small p-value (bad fit).
    Characteristics that cluster together may indicate underlying biological 
    relationships. For example, petal dimensions might reflect floral morphology.
    Traits close together along a significant factor axis suggest positive 
    relationships, indicating that they tend to increase or decrease together. 
    Conversely, traits that are far apart suggest a negative relationship.
